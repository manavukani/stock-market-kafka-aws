# Stock Market Kafka Real Time - Data Engineering Project

#### Objective  
Build end-to-end data pipeline for real-time data processing using Apache Kafka for streaming and AWS services for transformation, storage and analytics

#### Workflow  

1. Use Kafka to stream stock market data in real time.  
2. Host Kafka brokers on AWS EC2 for streaming.  
3. Use Glue to clean, transform, and catalog the data.  
4. Save raw and processed data in Amazon S3.  
5. Use Athena to query and analyze stock trends directly from S3.
